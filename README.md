# ISAU-J6
MIDI synthesizer plugin for my senior independent study

Features:

- Subtractive synth
- 2 Oscillators, can change the mix between the two
- Lowpass filter
- ADSR
- Master volume
- GUI

Is able to be integrated into most DAWs, there are still some issues with automation and persitency in the controls
